# this is for sonar-scanner pluggin to send data to sonar server

sonar.projectKey=backend # sonar server created a project under this key and name
sonar.projectName=backend 
sonar.sources= .  # which codes to scan , dot means all ; in realtime ,it will be /src/main
sonar.exclusions= node_modules,helm,Dockerfile,jenkinsfile,schema #these files will be ignored
sonar.tests=src/test #we need to provide the unit test results here to sonar

#we should also give code coverage report also to sonar.


# 🧠 Super Basic Breakdown (Like We’re Just Chatting):
# 👤 You: "Yo Sonar, check my code!"
# ☁️ Sonar: "Cool, I’ll look at your code structure, smells, bugs… but hey — you got any unit tests?"
# 👤 You: "Yeah."

# ☁️ Sonar: "Nice! Gimme the test report and code coverage too, then I’ll show you exactly which lines are tested and which are not."

# ---

# ## 🔧 What Happens If You DON'T Provide Tests to Sonar:

# - ✅ Sonar still runs → checks code style, duplication, complexity, bugs, security hotspots.
# - ❌ But code coverage will show 0%.
# - ❌ You won’t know which lines are covered by tests.
# - ❌ Quality Gate may fail if it expects minimum test coverage (common in CI/CD pipelines).
